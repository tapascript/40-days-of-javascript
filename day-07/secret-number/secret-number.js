/**
 * Let us play a number guessing game.
 * You will ask user for a number between 1 to 10. Once user will enter a number, you will tell user if the entered number is lower or higher. With this information, user will change the number and finally guess the right number. You also need to show the number of attempts made by users to rach to this right guess.
