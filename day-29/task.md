# Tasks

Please complete the following tasks and post them on the tapaScript Discord under "40 Days of JavaScript".

> **DO NOT USE AI to FIND ANSWERS**. If you are stuck, let's discuss it on DISCORD and learn. Also, please note that none of the answers need you to create any UI. Just focus on the logic building and print the output on the browser console.

## 1. Identify Real-Life Objects with OOP Concepts

Pick any 3 real-life objects (e.g., smartphone, bicycle, school), and for each:

- List at least 3 properties (attributes).
- List at least 3 behaviors (methods).
- Write which OOP principle each property or behavior best represents and why.

## 2. Draw a Diagram of an OOP Modeled System

Create a diagram (hand-drawn or digital) of a system like:

- A library system (Books, Members, Staff, etc.)
- Or a fast-food restaurant system (Orders, Menus, Employee)
In the diagram Show classes/objects

- Arrows to represent relationships like inheritance or composition
- Indicate which class encapsulates what data and methods

## 3. Explain OOP Principles with Human Analogies

 Write your own analogy (non-code) to explain each of the 5 OOP principles:

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Composition

It must be unique (not from the class), and explain how that analogy relates to programming.

## 4. Compare OOP vs Functional Thinking

Choose a simple system (e.g., a To-Do app or Alarm Clock) and:

- Describe how you’d design it using OOP (with objects)
- Describe how you’d design it using Functional Programming (with functions)

You don’t have to write code — just use words and bullets.

## 5. Object vs Class vs Function – Explain Like a Teacher

Imagine you’re teaching a 10-year-old:

- What is a Class?
- What is an Object?
- What is a Function?

Use simple language, drawings, or emojis if needed.
