# Tasks

Please complete the following tasks and post them on the tapaScript Discord under "40 Days of JavaScript".

> **DO NOT USE AI to FIND ANSWERS**. If you are stuck, let's discuss it on DISCORD and learn. Also, please note that none of the answers need you to create any UI. Just focus on the logic building and print the output on the browser console.

## 1. Split a Utility Library

Create a small utility library (e.g., math functions like add, subtract, multiply, divide) in separate module files and import them into a main index.js file to perform operations.

## 2. Create a Feature-Based Module Structure

Create a small blog app where:

- post.js handles posts
- user.js handles user info
- main.js brings it together via import

## 3. Use Named vs Default Exports

Create modules with both named and default exports, and demonstrate:

- How to import them correctly
- How to rename named exports during import

## 4. Mock an API Module

Create api.js that exports functions like fetchUsers, createUser, etc.

- Simulate network delays using setTimeout
- Use these in a frontend to display mock data

## 5. Quiz App Modularized

Modularize a quiz app:

- questions.js: array of questions
- quizLogic.js: handles quiz flow
- ui.js: handles DOM updates
- main.js: runs everything
