You have just finished the module 2. You have learned many important concepts till the session(day) 16. It is time to put everything together and do a project.

- Adding Expense
- Removing Expense
- Updating Expense
- Getting total expenses done by the user
- Getting expense by category
- Get the Highest Expense
- Get the Lowest Expense
- Get the user info
- Show all the expenses

 user: {
    name: "Tapas",
    budget: 5000,
