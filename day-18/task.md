# Tasks

Please complete the following tasks and post them on the tapaScript Discord under "40 Days of JavaScript".

> **DO NOT USE AI to FIND ANSWERS**. If you are stuck, let's discuss it on DISCORD and learn. Also, please note that none of the answers need you to create any UI. Just focus on the logic building and print the output on the browser console.

## 1. Create a form dynamically using JavaScript and manipulate its behavior

- Add input fields dynamically based on user selection e.g., text, email, number
- Add a submit button that logs all the input values as an object.
- Add a reset button that clears the form.
- Use createElement, appendChild, setAttribute, and addEventListener.

## 2. Add, delete, and search rows in a dynamic table

- A form to add rows (Name, Age, Role).
- Each row should have a “Delete” button to remove it.
- Add a search input that filters the rows by name.
- Use insertRow, deleteRow, and textContent/innerText.

## 3. Theme Switcher with Persistence

- Toggle theme using a button or switch.
- Persist the theme in localStorage and apply on page load.
- Change background and text color based on the theme.
